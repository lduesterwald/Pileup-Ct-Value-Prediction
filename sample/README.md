This folder contains the following files useful for testing and running the scripts in this repo:

* *pileup_model.pkl* - An example trained Ct value prediction model  
* *meta_data_file.csv* - A file containing the genome_ids and metadata for every pileup file used to train the model  

In order to properly clone or pull the pileup model, git lfs is needed and the following commands can be run:
* "git lfs clone https://github.com/lduesterwald/Pileup-Ct-Value-Prediction.git"
* "git lfs pull https://github.com/lduesterwald/Pileup-Ct-Value-Prediction.git"
